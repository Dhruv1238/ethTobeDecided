# ethTobeDecided

## Introduction

`ethTobeDecided` is an open-source toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. Built using TypeScript, it provides a robust foundation for developers to create and deploy smart contracts.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Solidity
- NextJS
- RainbowKit
- Hardhat
- Wagmi
- Viem

## Features

- **Contract Hot Reload**: Automatically adapts your frontend to your smart contract as you edit it.
- **Custom React Hooks**: Simplifies interactions with smart contracts using TypeScript.
- **Web3 Components**: A collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Easily test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- **Wallet Provider Integration**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- Node (>= v18.18)
- Yarn (v1 or v2+)
- Git

## Quickstart

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    cd my-dapp-example
    yarn install
    ```

2. **Run a local network**:
    ```sh
    yarn chain
    ```

3. **Deploy the test contract**:
    ```sh
    yarn deploy
    ```

4. **Start your NextJS app**:
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

Visit your app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Setup The Graph Integration

1. **Clean old data and spin up Docker containers**:
    ```sh
    yarn clean-node
    yarn run-node
    ```

2. **Create and ship your subgraph**:
    ```sh
    yarn local-create
    yarn local-ship
    ```

3. **Build Graph Client Artifacts**:
    ```sh
    yarn graphclient:build
    ```

## Available Commands

- **run-node**: Spin up a local graph node
- **stop-node**: Stop the local graph node
- **clean-node**: Remove local graph node data
- **local-create**: Create a local subgraph
- **local-remove**: Delete a local subgraph
- **abi-copy**: Copy contract ABI and generate networks.json
- **codegen**: Generate AssemblyScript types
- **build**: Compile and check mapping functions
- **local-deploy**: Deploy a local subgraph
- **local-ship**: Deploy a local subgraph with all required commands
- **deploy**: Deploy a subgraph to TheGraph
