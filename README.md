## **Future Scope**
1. Expand fitness challenges to include team competitions.
2. Introduce NFT rewards for milestones.
3. Enable social sharing to inspire others.


## **CLI Tool**
We built a **command-line interface (CLI) tool** to simplify the process of managing contract ownership. When a contract is deployed locally, it is owned by the default account generated by the local node. This tool allows you to seamlessly transfer ownership to your desired account without manually interacting with the blockchain. 

**Key Features:**
- Transfers ownership from the local node account to your specified account.
- Built using [Viem](https://viem.sh), ensuring speed and reliability.
- Reduces setup errors and accelerates the deployment process.
- After deploying contract run this command
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruv1238/ethToBeDecided.git
cd ethToBeDecided/packages/hardhat
npx hardhat transfer-ownership --contract DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --new-owner NEW_OWNER_ADDRESS
```

## **Steps to Run**
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruv1238/ethToBeDecided.git
cd ethToBeDecided
```
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```
3. Start the local blockchain
```bash
yarn chain
```
4. Deploy the smart contracts
```bash
yarn deploy
```
5. Start the frontend
```bash
yarn start
```
